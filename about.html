          <b><em>Coffee from Ethiopia </em></b>is known for its bright fruited
          and floral flavors. These coffees typically have a higher acidity,
          light to medium body and complex flavor notes. The beans are either
          washed or naturally processed.

          Perhaps one of the clearest reflections of coffee's role in Ethiopian
          culture is in its language.Coffee plays such a heavily ingrained role
          in Ethiopian culture that it appears in many expressions dealing with
          life, food, and interpersonal relationships.

          If one says,
          <strong>"I don't have anyone to have coffee with,"</strong> it is not
          taken literally, but assumed to mean that the person does not have
          good friends in whom they can confide. This relates closely to the
          enormous social role that coffee consumption plays in Ethiopia and the
          fact that people often gather over coffee for conversations that cover
          daily life, gossip, and deeper issues alike. Similarly, if someone
          says, "Don't let your name get noticed at coffee time," they mean that
          you should watch out for your reputation and avoid becoming the topic
          of negative gossip.
